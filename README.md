## Getting and Cleaning Data
### Class Assignment

This Repo contains one script, run_analysis.R that cleans a dataset from a Human Activity Recognition experiment using Samsung Galaxy cellphones. The script requires that either the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory and it's subdirectories is unzipped and located in your working directory, or that all the necessary .txt-datafiles are located in your working directory. It will return a tidy data set, as explained in the code book (CodeBook.md). The dataset can be downloaded here:

and more info about the dataset can be found here.
