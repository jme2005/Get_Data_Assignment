## Getting and Cleaning Data
### Class Assignment

This Repo contains one script, run_analysis.R that cleans a dataset from a Human Activity Recognition experiment using Samsung Galaxy cellphones. The script requires that either the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory and it's subdirectories, or all the data files necessary, are located in your working directory. It will return a tidy data set, as explained in the code book. The data required can be downloaded here:
